# Python-API_Challenge-HW6
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, I've taken what I've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, I know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

In this deliverable, I"ve create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and my problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. I've also used my weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, I used Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.

My main tasks was to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ my Python skills to create map visualizations.

To succeed on this deliverable of the assignment, I openned the VacationPy.ipynb starter code and complete the following steps:

Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

For this part, I used the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities. To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
